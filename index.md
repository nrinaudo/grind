kantan.xpath is an XPath expression evaluation library for the [Scala programming language](http://www.scala-lang.org).

## Getting started

kantan.xpath is currently available for Scala 2.12 and 2.13.

The current version is `0.6.0`, which can be added to your project with one or more of the following line(s)
in your SBT build file:

```scala
// Core library, included automatically if any other module is imported.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath" % "0.6.0"

// Java 8 date and time instances.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath-java8" % "0.6.0"

// Provides scalaz type class instances.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath-scalaz" % "0.6.0"

// Provides cats type class instances.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath-cats" % "0.6.0"

// Provides "dirty" HTML parsing through NekoHTML.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath-nekohtml" % "0.6.0"

// Provides refined decoders.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath-refined" % "0.6.0"

// Provides enumeratum decoders.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath-enumeratum" % "0.6.0"

// Provides libra decoders.
libraryDependencies += "com.nrinaudo" %% "kantan.xpath-libra" % "0.6.0"
```

## Motivation

Web scraping is something that I have to do with some regularity, and the standard Scala XML library is not well suited
for that task - not as well, at least, as a proper XPath implementation.

The standard Java library, on the other hand, has an acceptably efficient XPath API, but one that is hobbled, from a
Scala perspective, by terrible types and safety issues. Everything throws and everything is a node.

kantan.xpath, then, is a thin layer over that Java API that attempts to provide much needed safety, useful types
and as little boilerplate as possible.
